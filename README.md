## Hi there 👋

I have been programming for over ten years, during which I have learned a wide diversity of languages, from hardware chip design to web technologies, including scripting and low-level.

I define myself as an Ocaml Zealot 🐫⚔️

I'm open to work on open-source projects in Rust, OCaml, and Coq.
